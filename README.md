# AI for Cybersecurity in Automotive CAN Networks
__Intrusion Detection Systems(IDU) using Lightweight Machine Learning and Deep Learning__

## Project Overview
In this project, we are applying machine learning and deep learning to implement __lightweight intrusion detection system (IDS)__ for automotive Controller Area Network (CAN) traffic. The idea behind this project is to detect malicious CAN messages in real time on resource-constrained Electronic Control Units (ECUs).

To achieve this, we developed three models and compared their accuracies. 
|Model|LSTM|XGBoost|CNN (ID)|
|-----|----|----|----|
|__Accuracy__|__91%__|__89%__|__84%__|
